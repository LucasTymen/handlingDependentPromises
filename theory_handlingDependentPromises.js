/*
Async Await
Handling Dependent Promises

The true beauty of async...await is when we have a series of asynchronous
actions which depend on one another. For example, we may make a network request
based on a query to a database. In that case, we would need to wait to make the
network request until we had the results from the database. With native promise
syntax, we use a chain of .then() functions making sure to return correctly
each one:
*/

function nativePromiseVersion() {
  returnsFirstPromise()
    .then((firstValue) => {
      console.log(firstValue);
      return returnsSecondPromise(firstValue);
    })
   .then((secondValue) => {
      console.log(secondValue);
    });
}

/*
Let’s break down what’s happening in the nativePromiseVersion() function:

    Within our function we use two functions which return promises:
    returnsFirstPromise() and returnsSecondPromise().
    We invoke returnsFirstPromise() and ensure that the first promise resolved
    by using .then().
    In the callback of our first .then(), we log the resolved value of the first
    promise, firstValue, and then return returnsSecondPromise(firstValue).
    We use another .then() to print the second promise’s resolved value to the
    console.

Here’s how we’d write an async function to accomplish the same thing:
*/

async function asyncAwaitVersion() {
  let firstValue = await returnsFirstPromise();
  console.log(firstValue);
  let secondValue = await returnsSecondPromise(firstValue);
  console.log(secondValue);
}

/*
Let’s break down what’s happening in our asyncAwaitVersion() function:

    We mark our function as async.
    Inside our function, we create a variable firstValue assigned await
    returnsFirstPromise(). This means firstValue is assigned the resolved value
    of the awaited promise.
    Next, we log firstValue to the console.
    Then, we create a variable secondValue assigned to await
    returnsSecondPromise(firstValue). Therefore, secondValue is assigned this
    promise’s resolved value.
    Finally, we log secondValue to the console.

Though using the async...await syntax can save us some typing, the length
reduction isn’t the main point. Given the two versions of the function, the
async...await version more closely resembles synchronous code, which helps
developers maintain and debug their code. The async...await syntax also makes it
easy to store and refer to resolved values from promises further back in our
chain which is a much more difficult task with native promise syntax. Let’s
create some async functions with multiple await statements!
Instructions
1.

Take a look at the provided code. We require in three functions: shopForBeans(),
soakTheBeans(), and cookTheBeans(). These functions each return a promise.

    shopForBeans() expects no arguments and returns a promise which will resolve
    to a string of a bean type.
    soakTheBeans() expects a bean type string as an argument and returns a
    promise which resolves to a boolean indicating whether or not the beans are
    softened.
    cookTheBeans() expects a boolean as an argument and, if that value is true,
    returns a promise which will resolve to a string announcing that dinner is
    ready.

If you’d like, look at the library.js file to see how these functions work.
Press “Check Work” to move on to the next step.
2.

In the following checkpoints, you’ll create an async function that handles the
three dependent promises we just walked through. It will simulate shopping for,
soaking, and then cooking the beans. To get started, declare an async function,
makeBeans(). You can leave the function body blank for now.

Check your work to move on to the next step.

To declare an async function:

async function funcName() {

}


3.

Inside your function, declare a variable, type, assigned to the resolved value
of shopForBeans(). This must be accomplished in one statement.

This is the syntax for using the await operator:

const variableName = await returnsPromise();

4.

Next inside your function, declare a variable, isSoft, assigned to the resolved
value of soakTheBeans(). Don’t forget: the soakTheBeans() function expects an
argument. Make sure to pass the expected value into soakTheBeans().

The soakTheBeans() function expects a bean type string which is exactly what the
shopForBeans() function’s promise resolves to! You should pass your type
variable into soakTheBeans().

let isSoft = soakTheBeans(type);

5.

Next inside your function, declare a variable, dinner, assigned to the resolved
of cookTheBeans(). Don’t forget: the cookTheBeans() function also expects an
argument. Make sure to pass the expected value into cookTheBeans().

The cookTheBeans() function expects a boolean which is exactly what the
soakTheBeans() function’s promise resolves to! You should pass your isSoft
variable into cookTheBeans() when you invoke it.

let dinner = cookTheBeans(isSoft);

6.

Next inside your function, log your dinner variable to the console.
7.

Beneath your function declaration, invoke the makeBeans() function.
8.

Let’s see your async function in action! In the terminal, type node app.js and
press enter to execute the code. (Press “Check Work” when complete to continue)
